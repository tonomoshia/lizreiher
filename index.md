## About me

I live in South Florida, where the only "season" we concern ourselves with is hurricane season. I became interested in the online space and most importantly, how to modify it, during my MySpace phase. My MySpace page was killer, I cannot deny it. Having the ability to make the page look any way I wanted it to was really appealing and fun.

I have also been a paralegal for 23 years. I have a Bachelor's degree in Mass Communications from [Florida International University](http://www.fiu.edu/). I have an MBA from [Lake Forest Graduate School of Management](http://www.lfgsm.edu/). I am a self-taught developer. I worked through [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/tonomoshia), [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/), [Skillcrush](http://skillcrush.com/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) to learn about web development.

I have been attending [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/members/12462507/) for [Agile](https://www.meetup.com/South-Florida-Agile-Association/), [Coding](https://www.meetup.com/broward-ruby/), and [Wordpress](https://www.meetup.com/SF-WordPress-Users/) and have met a lot of really cool people as well as learned interesting things about the industry. My favorite Meetups are [South Florida Women in Agile](https://www.meetup.com/South-Florida-Women-In-Agile-Meetup/) and [South Florida Wordpress Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SF-WordPress-Users/).

I have been an organizer for [WordCamp Miami](https://2019.miami.wordcamp.org) since Fall 2017. I have really enjoyed helping people, meeting new people, and keeping South Florida informed about all things WordPress leading up to our annual conference.

A more formal listing of my work history is on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reiher/).
