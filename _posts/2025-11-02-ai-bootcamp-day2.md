## AI Bootcamp Day 2: Learning from Home, Experimenting with AI Tools

Day 2 of South Florida Tech Hub’s AI Bootcamp was fully virtual. We met over Zoom, which gave everyone a chance to work from home and still stay connected. The day was lighter on lectures and heavier on hands-on exploration, focused on testing different AI-powered development tools.

### Sharing and Discussion
We started with a group discussion, trading ideas about what we’d tried since Day 1 and how we might build on it. People shared early successes, frustrations, and new use cases they’d started imagining for AI-assisted workflows. It felt more like a collaborative lab than a class — everyone learning out loud.

### Breakout Sessions: Copilot, Cursor, and Replit
After that, we split into three breakout rooms based on which tool we wanted to use:  
1. **GitHub Copilot** — for those who wanted to keep exploring how AI can assist with coding and automation.  
2. **Cursor.com** — an editor built for AI-driven development, ideal for trying something new.  
3. **Replit** — an online environment for quickly prototyping code with integrated AI support.

You could jump between rooms if you wanted — for example, someone who used Copilot on Day 1 could pop into the Cursor room to experiment with a different workflow. I liked that flexibility; it turned the session into a real sandbox rather than a fixed track.

### My Focus for the Day
I used the time to test how Copilot handled more complex prompts after I’d set it up the day before. It’s one thing to generate snippets; it’s another to use it as a true coding partner. I tried refining my queries and watched how its suggestions changed. It reminded me how much precision matters when working with AI — the clearer the context, the better the collaboration.

### Takeaway
Day 2 wasn’t about building something new; it was about *playing* — testing boundaries, switching tools, and learning how AI fits into everyday workflows. Working virtually gave it a different energy: less structured, more experimental.  

On Day 3 (next Saturday), we head back in person for the final day, where we’ll start building prototypes and talking about what happens after the bootcamp.
