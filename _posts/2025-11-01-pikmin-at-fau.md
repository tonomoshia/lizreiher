# Pikmin at FAU

While I attended the [South Florida Tech Hub AI Bootcamp](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/techhubsouthflorida_tech-hubs-first-ai-bootcamp-is-kicking-activity-7388599921739763712-u95H), my Pikmin explored Florida Atlantic University's Boca Raton campus. 

They visited Engineering East, admired the Binary Bench coded in 1s and 0s, and posed with the Forkas Owl, FAU’s beloved symbol of wisdom and creativity.

While I was diving into AI, my Pikmin were learning their own lessons in engineering and design — a perfect mix of tech, art, and tiny adventurers.
